# Data Collection Journal

# Introduction
## Date: [E
This notebook is a journal to document my experiences and challenges during the data collection process for my project. 

# Data Collection Details
## Objective:
Data standardization is converting data into a standard format that computers can easily understand and use


## Data Source:
collecting data from a mix of resources such as websites and in person

## Data Type:
Business Name: This is textual data and typically falls under the "string" data type. Standardizing it might involve ensuring consistent capitalization and formatting (e.g., always using "Holborn Cafe" instead of "holborn cafe" or "Holborn Caf√©").
Postcode: This is alphanumeric data and can be standardized by ensuring a consistent format, such as removing spaces and converting all letters to uppercase (e.g., WC1A1AB).
Phone Number: This is numerical data but is usually treated as a string due to the presence of dashes or spaces. Standardizing it might involve removing special characters and ensuring a consistent format (e.g., 02012345678).
Social Media: This is textual data and typically falls under the "string" data type. Standardizing it might involve ensuring consistent formatting (e.g., always using "facebook.com/holborncafe" instead of variations like "www.facebook.com/holborncafe").
Business Hours: This data represents time intervals and days of the week. Standardizing it might involve converting the time to a 24-hour format for consistency (e.g., "8:00 AM - 6:00 PM" becomes "08:00 - 18:00"). Additionally, you could represent the days consistently, such as using "Mon" for Monday and "Sat" for Saturday.

# Challenges Encountered
## Challenge 1:
**Date:** [3/10/23]
**Issue:** [unable to obtain information on social media accounts.]
**Description:** [cause for this may be social media acoounts are kept for personal use hence someone may not acknowlage a workplace professional account]

## Challenge 2:
**Date:** [3/10/23]
**Issue:** [no phone numbers available ]
**Description:** due to the rise in misuse of numbers many stores choose to in workplace numbers available only 

# Solutions and Workarounds
## Challenge 1 (Continued):
**Date:** [3/10/23]
**Solution:** [we went on certain social media accounts like facebook ,instasgram,twitter and typed in keywords for eg.'Holbourn costa'.]

## Challenge 2 (Continued):
**Date:** [3/10/23]
**Solution:** [we had to disregard that category and keep another contact such as their email to have a liable medium of communication.]

# Insights and Observations
[insights available will be how this information can be stored especially with the use of notes and other apps rather than writing on paper an observation will be that everything is available online and all the information is accsessed there.]

# Personal Reflections
[collect data on apps rather than paper no risk of losing any information]

# Conclusion
[concluding our reasearch helped us identify that there are many ways a person can standardise data and that we have a real world application to how we make information more readable in real life as the way we make it readable in a simple way for computer.]
